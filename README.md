Not sure what happened to my readme from lab 4 - seems like it never got uploaded to github some how :0 sorry about that 

In this lab, I built the react&redux blog frontend. I admittedly didn't do my finest work on the styling of this lab but I think it was at least mostly functional.

For lab 5 part2, I added a protected route and sign in/sign up pages and routes and a navbar. Making adjustments to mesh the front end with the backend was somewhat difficult but overall not too bad.
